## Development

This repository uses Node.js 26 and pnpm 12.18.0. To select the pinned Node.js version with nvm and install pnpm, run:

```bash
nvm use
npm install --global pnpm@12.18.0
```

## Running tests

To run the tests in watch mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

This spawns two vitest processes and you can interact with them in the terminal. However, input is passed to the processes in sequence making it tricky to use.

To get a standard vitest interface, you can run the tests separately:

```bash
pnpm test:unit --watch
# or
pnpm test:integration --watch
```
